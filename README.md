<h2 align="center">Hi! This is Ravi Sharma 👋🤓</h2>
<p align="center">I'm a Frontend Developer, Graphic Designer, UI/UX Designer and Coffee Lover.
I'm also currently doing my B.Tech in CSE while working on many other projects too.
I am currently passionate about ReactJs, Progressive Web Apps, creating digital strategies products and services for companies and startups.
In my free time, I like to capture photographs of the serene beauty of nature. I highly value the balance between work and personal life. My interest includes travelling, exploring and capturing the moment. When I am not working, you will find me indulged in playing badminton, movies and friends. I love meeting new people and learning new things. Love to be the version of myself!</p>
